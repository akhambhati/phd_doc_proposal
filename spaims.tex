Localization-related epilepsy accounts for $\sim$80\% of drug-resistant cases and is traditionally characterized by seizures that arise from one or more abnormal islands of cortical tissue, or `foci', in the neocortex or mesial temporal structures. For these patients the only treatment options are implantable neuromodulation devices, or more traditionally resective surgery. Modest outcomes associated with resective surgery has lead investigators to further explore spatial distributions of epileptic activity to more accurately localize where seizures start and how their pathologic activity spreads. These approaches have spurred a paradigm shift from localizing epileptic ‘foci’ towards mapping epileptic network architecture.

While seizures are often described by their complex temporal dynamics, the functional connections responsible for spatial interactions within the epileptogenic network remain elusive. Mapping network architecture can broadly impact theoretical understanding of seizure mechanisms and clinical therapy for managing seizures.
Specifically, this thesis asks the following three overarching questions regarding epileptic network structure and function in clinical cohorts with varying localization-related etiologies:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=1ex, itemsep=0pt]
    \item Which functional connections play a role in the generation, propagation, and self-termination of seizures?
    \item How do these functional connections interact during inter-ictal periods?
    \item Can inter-ictal functional connectivity localize where seizures are generated?
\end{enumerate}
