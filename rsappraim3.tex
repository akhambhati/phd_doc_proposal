\subsection{Aim 3}
While the first two aims of this thesis seek a formalized definition of the epileptic network, the final aim will address accuracy and specificity of a network-based approach to define surgical targets over a patient population with diverse etiology of neocortical epilepsy.

\subsubsection{Justification}
A difficulty in treating neocortical epilepsy is an incomplete understanding of where seizures originate and the true extent of the epileptogenic network. This aim evaluates different components of the epileptic network as targets for resection based on outcome data. The results from this study may be used as preliminary data to prospectively determine surgical targets guided by epileptic network functional architecture.
